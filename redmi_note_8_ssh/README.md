# Redmi Note 8 SSH Scripts
Some scripts I wrote for connecting to my Redmi Note 8 rooted Android phone running Android 15 through an SSH connection.

These scripts are just for connecting to the phone, it should be pretty easy for one to make a script for themselves like the ones in this folder, but I have uploaded the code here anyways.

And a side note, I have used AI to add "echo"es to the code so it shows whatever process or command it's doing at a time.

If you have any issues or bug reports regarding this (if you find one then idk what to do cuz I don't think you ever would, but still) report them by opening an issue in this repo with prefix "RN8-SSH-SCRIPTS: "

Thanks for reading lol
